# AdapTable Server-Side Row Model Demo
This small demo application illustrates how to use AG Grid's [Server-Side RowModel](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-data-grid/server-side-model/) inside [AdapTable](https://www.adaptabletools.com/).

The demo is based on AG Grid's own [nodejs example](https://www.ag-grid.com/react-data-grid/server-side-operations-nodejs/) and uses the same data source.

It is a copy of the demo example provided in [Adaptable Docs](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/dev-guide-row-models-server-overview)

In particular the demo shows how - with very little custom code - you are still able to leverage key features in AdapTable while using the Server-Side Row Model, including:

- [Evaluating Predicates](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/adaptable-predicate) (primarily used in [Column Filters](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/handbook-column-filter))
- [Evaluating Expressions](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/adaptable-ql-expression) (used extensively in AdapTable e.g. for Queries, Alerts and Calculated Columns)
- [Getting Distinct Column Values](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/dev-guide-tutorial-column-values)
- [Pivot Layouts](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/handbook-layouts-pivot)
- [Custom Sorts](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/handbook-sorting-custom)
- [Export](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/handbook-exporting)

**Note: The code is provided as a Starter Guide for demonstration purposes only: it's NOT production ready and shouldn't be used as is**

Additionally, the example includes a small subset of the huge number of other features in AdapTable - which are available in Server-Side Row Model with **no** custom code required:

- [Gradient Styles](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/handbook-styled-column-gradient)
- [Layouts](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/handbook-layouts)
- [Custom Toolbars](https://docs.adaptabletools.com/guide/ui-dashboard-custom-toolbars)
